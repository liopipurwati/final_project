# final_project
This is my final project to obtain an associate degree at Semarang State University with the topic "Implementation of the Support Vector Machine Algorithm and IndoBERT in Sentiment Analysis of User Reviews of the DANA Application on the Google Play Store".

The conclusions that can be drawn in this final research project are as follows.
1. The results of user sentiment reviews of the DANA digital wallet application on the Google Play Store site which were uploaded in the period 10â€“21 April 2023 mostly contain reviews with negative sentiment. Many of these negative reviews occurred on April 17, 2023.
2. Complaints that are often complained about by DANA application users based on visualizations from word clouds and bar charts are applications that often have errors or are difficult to open, balances that are not entered, and balances that are lost
